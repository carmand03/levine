The Chinese experienced dynamic changes in the twentieth century and few groups were as transitional as Chinese intellectuals. Grappling with new roles within the world of education and politics, there was an explosion of creative and diverse responses. This study will utilize data on 197 Chinese students who matriculated at four European universities, the Institut Franco-Chinois de Lyon, Université du Travail Charleroi, Université de Paris, and the Universität zu Berlin. The article will profile these students through a narrative of common experiences; statistical analyses of 205 different types of affiliation, geospatial analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis; followed by network analyses (cohesion, triad, centrality) and network visualization. The data clearly show characteristic subgroups in geospatial subgroups, hierarchical clusters, and network subgroup analyses that align with known historical data. For example, the dispersion among these four institutions of students from Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan have discernable patterns, as do the selection of institution, and the participation in European branches of Chinese political parties by these Chinese students. The study also raises comparative generational questions, particularly about the life trajectories of Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei and their relationship to these European institutions and Chinese higher education. Finally, the article illustrates how an historical integrative approach provides both new insights about how the Chinese political intellectuals had adapted individually and grouped together into political parties and political factions, while pursuing academic careers.
